This project contains my implementation of the Autumn coding challenge. 

I have implemented 3 pages:
 - Home page (index.html)
 - Form page (form.html)
 - Submission results page (excellent.html)
 
 The technologies I have used are: 
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JS
 - Bootstrap
 - a little bit of JQuery and ajax for the request
